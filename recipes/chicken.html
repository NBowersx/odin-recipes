    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>3 cups cooked old-fashioned regular rolled oats</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded yellow squash or zucchini</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded carrots </li>
    <li>1 cup frozen green peas, thawed</li>
    <li>Â½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
  </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
  
    <ol>
    
    <li>Place chicken breasts in a large saucepan; add water until chicken is covered. Bring to a boil over high, and once water boils, reduce heat to medium. Simmer until chicken is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat, and let chicken cool in chicken broth in saucepan for 30 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Transfer chicken to a cutting board, reserving broth. Chop chicken into small pieces. Combine chicken, oats, shredded vegetables, peas, and parsley in a large bowl. Add reserved chicken broth, 1/2 cup at a time, until desired consistency is reached based on your dog's palate.</li>

    <li>To store dog food: Place in ziplock plastic bags, seal and store in refrigerator up to 3 to 4 days, or in freezer up to 3 weeks. Check with your veterinarian to determine your dog's nutritional needs and serving size.</li>
